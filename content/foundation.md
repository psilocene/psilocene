## Introduction

The Psilocene Foundation is an organization that embodies a growing set of initiatives to act upon psychedelic knowledge to obtain real change in the world and bring the psychedelic community together. We aim to work and think from an evidential, rational perspective. We may all have different ideas about existence, but the psychedelic experience has written "Find the Others" on our minds. Psilocene is a grassroots "Find the Others" campaign that has initiatives to bring psychedelic substances out from the shadows.

## Organization

* Psilocene Foundation
  * Psilocene Collective


For more detail, refer to the [Organization Outline](../organization)

## Psilocene Foundation

The foundation would house any child organizations that are created for a specific purpose.

### Child organizations
#### [Psilocene Collective](../collective)

A broad coalition of skilled, crowdsourced individuals that volunteer to work together on projects focused on harm reduction, proliferation of fact-based information, and other needs in the community.

Volunteers will work together democratically to complete projects.

[//]: # (#### [Psilocene Society](../society/about-society))

[//]: #  (A nonreligious fellowship of individuals that wish to band together for the mutual fulfillment of true purpose. Members would have the means to communicate with each other and meet in person.)

### Governance
It is proposed that governance for the foundation and its children be implemented using blockchain technology when it reaches stability.

A board of directors will be formed of individuals that are recruited for experience, talent, knowledge, leadership acumen, or other valued attributes. We will attempt to recruit the best minds from within the psychedelic community and seek their help in realizing the vision of Psilocene. Some board members may serve on the board of the Foundation and a child organization.

#### Board of Directors
Members of the board will have equal voting rights on proposals and motions. Some board members may wish to keep their identity private from the public, and this is believed to be possible to accommodate.
