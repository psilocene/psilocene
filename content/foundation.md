## Introduction

Psilocene is an organization of like-minded individuals that have realized their true nature and desire to help others do the same. This realization is often achieved with the aid of psychedelic substances or mystical practices.

Once one's true nature is understood or integrated, one becomes more aware than ever of the need to work towards the betterment of humankind, all other life, and our home, Earth.

While many know that psychedelics can make one more inclined towards preserving nature and being loving, perspectives of reality can vary greatly. People that are not familiar with the mystical experience often dismiss people who have had them.

Psilocene aims to be results-based and grounded in evidential, scientific knowledge.

## Organization

* Psilocene Foundation
  * Psilocene Collective


For more detail, refer to the [Organization Outline](../organization)

## Psilocene Foundation

The foundation would house any child organizations that are created for a specific purpose.

### Child organizations
#### [Psilocene Collective](../collective)

A broad coalition of skilled, crowdsourced individuals that volunteer to work together on projects focused on harm reduction, proliferation of fact-based information, and other needs in the community.

Volunteers will work together democratically to complete projects.

[//]: # (#### [Psilocene Society](../society/about-society))

[//]: #  (A nonreligious fellowship of individuals that wish to band together for the mutual fulfillment of true purpose. Members would have the means to communicate with each other and meet in person.)

### Governance
It is proposed that governance for the foundation and its children be implemented using blockchain technology when it reaches stability.

A board of directors will be formed of individuals that are recruited for experience, talent, knowledge, leadership acumen, or other valued attributes. We will attempt to recruit the best minds from within the psychedelic community and seek their help in realizing the vision of Psilocene. Some board members may serve on the board of the Foundation and a child organization.

#### Board of Directors
Members of the board will have equal voting rights on proposals and motions. Some board members may wish to keep their identity private from the public, and this is believed to be possible to accommodate.
