The Psilocene Church is an ambitious endeavor to create the framework for a religion that allows for meaningful religious practice including the sacramental use of entheogenic substances. A large focus is put on allowing the mystical experiences to inform belief of adherents rather than to impose any particular interpretation of them.

The project has a few goals:

* be carefully constructed to withstand legal challenge
* provide a framework for meaningful spirituality through mystical, entheogenic experience
* construct a [chrestomathy](http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy/a_preface.html#definition)
* outline rituals or ceremonies that adherents may participate in to facilitate and provide context to the use of psychedelic sacraments.

The Church documents and charter will be *open source*. It expected to be a careful and gradual process of collaboration with many experts before any actual incorporation is to take place. The object is to have the groundwork done for a bona-fide religion that can withstand legal challenge in the United States and other countries.
