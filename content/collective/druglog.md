A service will be offered to all individuals to log personal drug usage.

Personal drug usage will be encrypted. Great care will be taken to shield the end user from legal reprisal from logging drug use.

The premise of this project is that an individual that uses substances does not wish to harm his or her body or experience, but enhance it. There is an abundance of false information in circulation about many substances. Because drug users often do not possess the knowledge or understanding to safely use the substances they choose to consume, many become addicted, are hospitalized, suffer bodily or psychological injury, or die. If drug users had a tool to enable them to be responsible and safe with their their dosages, then much harm will have been averted.

A mechanism for sharing anonymized drug usage logs is planned. Users can submit their usage logs for overall analysis so that it can be analyzed to provide important emerging insights to other users.
