A rough draft of potential child organizations



* Psilocene Collective
    * A collective of talented, skilled individuals that share the vision. The collective will develop projects that:
        * reduce harm
        * increase visibility of accurrate information
        * any other public good
* Psilocene Society
    * A society of people that have realized their true nature, and wish to be involved in helping others within and without the society
        * realize their true nature
        * be empowered to achieve true purpose
* Psilocene Church
    * The church is an ambitious endeavor to create the framework for a religion that allows for meaningful worship with the sacramental use of entheogenic substances. A large focus is put on allowing the mystical experiences to inform belief of adherents rather than to impose any particular interpretation of them.
    * The church documents and charter would be open-source.
    * The church would be formed such that governments would be compelled to recognize that our legitimate use of entheogenic substances is essential to our religious beliefs and protect the right to religious freedom.
* Psilocene Civil Liberties Union
    * Lawyers and legal staff that advise, defend, and prepare the Psilocene foundation and psychedelic interests.
* Psilocene Voice
    * A publication, website, and/or podcast that invites community voices to be heard.
* Psilocene Portal
    * A collection of links to psychedelic resources on the internet.
* Psilocene Picks
    * Knowledgeable or influential members of the psychedelic community are invited to provide a list of resources that helped them reach their current understanding, position, and path. This can include books, talks, conferences, or any other resource that they would like to share with those looking to expand their understanding. There would also be a section included that showcases that person's contributions to the community.
