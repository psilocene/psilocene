        * reduce harm
        * increase visibility of accurrate information
        * any other public good

    * A society of people that have realized their true nature, and wish to be involved in helping others within and without the society
        * realize their true nature
        * be empowered to achieve true purpose
* Psilocene Church
    * The church is an ambitious endeavor to create the framework for a religion that allows for meaningful worship with the sacramental use of entheogenic substances.
    * The church documents and charter would be open-source.
    * The church policies and tenets would be such that governments would be compelled to recognize our legitimate use of entheogenic substances.
* Psilocene Civil Liberties Union
    * A lawyers and legal staff that advise, defend, and prepare the Psilocene foundation, and in certain circumstances, defend the civil liberties of entheogen users.
* Psilocene Voice
