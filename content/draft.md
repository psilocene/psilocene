Psilocene is an organization of like-minded individuals that have realized their true nature and desire to help others do the same. This realization is often achieved with the aid of psychedelic substances or mystical practices.

Once one's true nature is understood or integrated, one becomes more aware than ever of the need to work towards the betterment of humankind, all other life, and our home, Earth.

While many know that psychedelics can make one more inclined towards preserving nature and being loving, perspectives of reality can vary greatly. People that are not familiar with the mystical experience often dismiss people who have had them.
