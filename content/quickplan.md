So, I need to think really quickly of what to do with psilocene.

I originally thought of psilocene being a society of people that were brought together by the knowledge and insights that come from psychedelic experience. I'm not really quite sure what that would entail even now, but I think that there are opportunities for it to expand. I think I have arrived at a few different arms of what the overall organization could be.

1. Psilocene Foundation
    1. Psilocene Society
      - A community of fellowship of those that demonstrate that they have had an experience that has endowed them with the knowledge of their own true nature.
      - The community is focused on lifting each other up from within and without the society in everything.
      - Membership would be available to sponsored initiates that can demonstrate their true nature and purpose.
      - People of any gender, race, nationality, economic status, sexual orientation are eligible for induction. Joining the society will not be easy, and initiates will be tested.
      - Generally members will share a common perspective on the nature of reality and existence, and although they may be wealthy or poor, will demonstrate that wealth is merely a tool.
      - The society will work together to realize the purposes of each individual member and those outside of the society that may not be members, but are aligned with the society.
      - The society realizes it has a vested interest in the future availability of entheogens, and protecting their use.
      - The society will share information relevant to its purpose, but abstain from dogma, rumors, unsubstantiated claims presented as truth as a matter of official policy. Opinions and ideas are welcome so long as they are presented as subjective and personal in nature.
    2. Psilocene Collective
      - The Collective is the service arm of the foundation that recruits like minded individuals to do good in the world with a group that shares the same interests and talents.
      - Obtaining membership is less rigorous than in the Society. One needs to share the vision, and have a skill that can aid in realizing our goals.
      - Members demonstrate a level of circumspection and unity that counteracts disputes and individual ownership/ego on work. We work together because we understand the stakes.
    3. Psilocene Church
      - The Church exists to provide an ad-hoc framework for dogma-free and meaningful spiritual practice that includes ritualistic substance use.
      - The Church is an organization that manages a confidential registry of adherent.
      - The tenets are simple:
        - We believe that we exist and are conscious.
        - We declare that it is our religious mandate to explore this existence and consciousness by means of experience.
        - We declare it our inalienable right to fulfill our mandate by altering our consciousness, without respect to the origin of this alteration.
        - If there exists any substance or practice that
          - has an action to alter consciousness in such a way that may provide a person with a spiritual or edifying experience
          - does not harm the mind or the body where either would be permanently impaired such that the individual is left with an overall detriment as a result of partaking
          - then we declare it to be a sacrament that may seed a ritual that would include its sacred use.
        - One must be a member in good standing to eligible to partake of the sacraments.
        - A shaman is a member that is trained to officiate in a ritual,
          - including the spiritual significance and meaning,
          - the performance and execution of the ritual,
          - all safety procedures and protocol involved with any sacraments used within the ritual.
          - A shaman guards the rituals and sacraments he has been entrusted with from the uninitiated and unprepared as his sacred duty.
        - A ritual is
          - held in a controlled environment and setting where only members in good standing, also having been prepared with knowledge about the significance of the ritual and safety procedures
          - contains a predefined set of actions and/or sacraments that are administered by a shaman to bring about a spiritual, transformative experience
          - is administered by shaman certified as having been trained in the safety procedures, use of the sacraments, the nature of the experience or altered state of consciousness, and any other integral parts pertaining to the ritual in which the shaman will officiate.
        - To gain full membership and become eligible for participation in rituals, an initiate must
          - Demonstrate that they have a lifestyle free from harmful addictions, and maintain it
          - Declare with sincerity that he or she wishes to engage in the religious exploration of existence and consciousness in a responsible manner.
          - Must demonstrate that he/she is not merely joining to abuse or gain access to the sacraments.
          - Demonstrate knowledge of some rituals.
          - Pledge to respect the sacraments and honor safety instructions provided during their use and during rituals.
          - Pledge to not share sacraments or sacred rituals with the uninitiated.
          - Pledge to stay within the bounds of the ritual as provided by the Church.
          - Demonstrate respect for the sacred rituals, and understand the importance.
          - Pledge to respect the privacy and confidentiality of other members.
          - Pledge to help others by conducting rituals, providing sacramental materials or other ways.
          - Pledge to not to present own ideas or thoughts as fact
          - Pledge to assist in the journey of others as directed by each individual without injecting personal dogma.
