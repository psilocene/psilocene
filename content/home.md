# Psilocene

## What is this?

The [Psilocene Foundation](foundation) is an organization that embodies a growing set of psychedelic initiatives.  

Psilocene is the embodiment of psychedelic thinking and acting. Technology enables individuals to work together and collaborate in a way that was never before possible. Psilocene harnesses the power of like-minded individuals that volunteer time or resources to collaborate on projects that the psychedelic community recognizes as priorities. Psilocene is a way we can come together.

## How can I help?

### Join the Psilocene Foundation; Help plan and develop
We need people that share the vision and are able to continue to develop the framework and proposals that have been started.

The [Psilocene Foundation](foundation) is the parent entity that is being proposed to encompass a wide variety of initiatives. Please read the [proposal](foundation) and send us any ideas you may have.

* Please get in contact with us: [staff@psilocene.org](mailto:staff@psilocene.org)

### Psilocene Registry

The [Registry](registry) is a collection of psychedeic resources on the internet. We would love help to collect and organize these links to provide to people that may not know what is out there.


### Psilocene Collective

The [Psilocene Collective](collective) is a broad coalition of skilled individuals that volunteer to work together on projects focused on harm reduction, proliferation of fact-based information, and other needs in the community. Technology enables individuals to work together in a way that was never before possible. Like-minded individuals will volunteer time or resources to collaborate on projects that are important to the psychedelic community. The Collective is a way we can come together.

Currently, the [Drug Log](collective/druglog) is a project that is in the planning stage. It will be an open source project that will depend on the participation of software developers, lawyers, and doctors that are in the psychedelic community.

### Psilocene Church

The [Psilocene Church](church) is an ambitious endeavor to create the framework for a religion that allows for meaningful religious practice including the sacramental use of entheogenic substances. A large focus is put on allowing the mystical experiences to inform belief of adherents rather than to impose any particular interpretation of them.

The Church documents and charter will be **open source**. It expected to be a careful and gradual process of collaboration with many experts before any actual incorporation is to take place. The object is to have the groundwork done for a bona-fide religion that can **withstand legal challenge** in the United States and other countries.
