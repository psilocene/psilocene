# Welcome to Psilocene

psilo- : word-forming element meaning "stripped, bare," from Greek psilos "bare, naked; mere,"

-cene: denoting a recent geological period; from Greek kainos new

### psilocene --  a new period in which humanity returns to harmony with itself and nature, stripping away the dogma and hatred among it.

## What is this?

Psilocene is the embodiment of psychedelic thinking and acting. Technology enables individuals to work together and collaborate in a way that was never before possible. Psilocene harnesses the power of like-minded individuals that volunteer time or resources to collaborate on projects that the psychedelic community recognizes as priorities. Psilocene is a way we can come together.

## How can I help?

### Psilocene Collective

The [Psilocene Collective](collective) is a broad coalition of skilled individuals that volunteer to work together on projects focused on harm reduction, proliferation of fact-based information, and other needs in the community.

Currently, the [Drug Log](collective/druglog) is a project that is in the planning stage. It will be an open source project that will depend on the participation of software developers, lawyers, and doctors that are in the psychedelic community.

### Help plan and develop the Psilocene Foundation
This project is still in its infancy. We need people that share the vision and are able to continue to develop the framework and proposals that have been started.

The [Psilocene Foundation](foundation) is the parent entity that is being proposed to encompass a wide variety of initiatives. Please read the [proposal](foundation) and send us any ideas you may have.

Do you have an idea? Please get in contact with us: [psilocene@tuta.io](mailto:psilocene@tuta.io)
