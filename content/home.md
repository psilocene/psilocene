# Welcome to Psilocene

psilo- : word-forming element meaning "stripped, bare," from Greek psilos "bare, naked; mere,"

-cene: denoting a recent geological period; from Greek kainos new

### psilocene --  a new epoch in which humanity returns to harmony with itself and nature by stripping away the darkness within

A new renaissance is taking place on the global stage. Psychedelics are once again being recognized as important tools to correct humanity from its destructive path. Many people are having mystical experiences and are waking up to the truth and reality, but wonder about what they can do to make a difference.

Psilocene is a group of people that have woken up to reality. We want to know each other. We want to work together. For real change, we must work together.


## What is this?

The [Psilocene Foundation](foundation) is an organization that embodies a growing set of initiatives to act upon psychedelic knowledge to obtain real change in the world and bring the psychedelic community together. We aim to work and think from an evidential, rational perspective. We may all have different ideas about existence, but the psychedelic experience has written "Find the Others" on our minds. Psilocene is a grassroots "Find the Others" campaign that has initiatives to bring psychedelic substances out from the shadows.

Psilocene is the embodiment of psychedelic thinking and acting. Technology enables individuals to work together and collaborate in a way that was never before possible. Psilocene harnesses the power of like-minded individuals that volunteer time or resources to collaborate on projects that the psychedelic community recognizes as priorities. Psilocene is a way we can come together.

## How can I help?

### Psilocene Collective

The [Psilocene Collective](collective) is a broad coalition of skilled individuals that volunteer to work together on projects focused on harm reduction, proliferation of fact-based information, and other needs in the community. Technology enables individuals to work together in a way that was never before possible. Like-minded individuals will volunteer time or resources to collaborate on projects that are important to the psychedelic community. The Collective is a way we can come together.

Currently, the [Drug Log](collective/druglog) is a project that is in the planning stage. It will be an open source project that will depend on the participation of software developers, lawyers, and doctors that are in the psychedelic community.

### Join the Psilocene Foundation; Help plan and develop
This project is still in its infancy. We need people that share the vision and are able to continue to develop the framework and proposals that have been started.

The [Psilocene Foundation](foundation) is the parent entity that is being proposed to encompass a wide variety of initiatives. Please read the [proposal](foundation) and send us any ideas you may have.
